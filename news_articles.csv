Goldman Sachs axes diversity rule that has 'served its purpose',"Goldman Sachs' international boss has said the bank ditched an internal diversity rule that barred it from advising all male, all white boards on company flotations because it was no longer needed. The investment bank had pledged that it would only help a business sell its shares on a stock exchange if it had two diverse board members, one of which had to be a woman. But Richard Gnodde told the BBC: ""That policy was put in place to try and drive a change in behaviour and I think that's happened."" In a wide-ranging interview, he also said the UK government needed to get on and start infrastructure projects now and warned that uncertainty over US policy was dampening firms' ""animal spirit"".

'Ineffective' generic drugs fuel rare public anger in China,"Public anger in China over concerns raised by doctors that generic drugs used in public hospitals are increasingly ineffective has led to a rare response from the government. Doctors say they believe the country's drug procurement system, which incentivises the use of cheap generic drugs over original brand-name pharmaceuticals, has led to costs being cut at the expense of people's safety. But officials, quoted by multiple state media outlets on Sunday, say the issue is one of perception rather than reality. One report said different people simply had different reactions to medicines and that claims about them being ineffective had ""mostly come from people's anecdotes and subjective feelings"".",2025-02-11,BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceve1xpdjxro,health
"Nigeria oil: Shell ignored warnings of spill clean-up 'scam', whistleblower tells BBC","A BBC investigation has uncovered allegations that energy giant Shell has ignored repeated warnings that a controversial clean-up operation of oil-polluted areas of southern Nigeria has been beset by problems and corruption. The multinational headquartered in London, along with the Nigerian government, has repeatedly stated that work to clean up oil-contaminated sites of Ogoniland, which kicked off around eight years ago, is going well. But the BBC has discovered evidence that they were warned repeatedly over several years that the scheme, set up by the government and funded by various oil firms to the tune of $1bn (£805m), has been suffering from a string of issues. One close observer has described the clean-up project as a ""con"" and a ""scam"" that has wasted money and left the people of Ogonliland in the Niger Delta region continuing to live with the devastating impact of oil pollution - 13 years after a ground-breaking UN report lifted the lid on the seriousness of their situation.",2025-02-12,BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rqe85q1jno,environment
